Hi Tomas! We are going to write a story and share it, for GitHub practice. Remember, practice makes perfect.

I'll start. 


Once upon a time, there lived a handsome kitten named Kiba.

Kiba was one of the best of his species.

He was admired by every cat in his village and every human wanted to take care of him. 

One day, he decided to get on top of the counter top because he was hungry. He knocked down his tub of food!

His Tomas got mad at him and called him fat, but his Joycell said, "He must be hungry."
